## [0.3.5] - 2025-09-04

### 🎨 Template Improvements

#### RedPill Template Enhancements
- **Fixed text overflow issues** - Changed overflow strategy to `exceed_width` to prevent vertical text overflow
- **Improved AI word highlighting** - Consolidated all highlighting to use `.word.emphasis` class instead of `.word.highlight`
- **Better text boundaries** - Reduced `max_width_ratio` from 0.75 to 0.65 for more comfortable edge padding
- **Increased line capacity** - Expanded `max_number_of_lines` from 2 to 3 for better text distribution
- **Enhanced emphasis styling** - Bright red background (#ff0000) with gold text (#FFD700) for AI-highlighted words

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed text overflow in RedPill template that caused subtitles to exceed viewport boundaries
- Removed duplicate CSS selectors for word highlighting functionality
- Corrected text wrapping behavior for long subtitle segments

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Cleaned up CSS styling rules in RedPill template
- Optimized layout configuration for better responsive behavior
- Improved text positioning with proper padding and boundaries

## [0.3.2] - 2025-08-22

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Translation System Fixes
- **Fixed partial translation bug** where only half of the segments would be translated
- **Improved batch translation reliability** for both Google Translate and DeepL services
- **Enhanced separator preservation handling** when translation services don't preserve `[SEP]` markers
- **Added robust fallback logic** to ensure all segments get translated individually if batching fails
- **Improved error logging** with detailed warnings about translation failures
- **Added array length validation** to prevent segments from being skipped during translation

#### Translation Quality Improvements
- **Better error recovery** - segments that fail translation now fallback gracefully to individual translation
- **Comprehensive segment validation** - ensures every segment gets processed even with service failures  
- **Enhanced debugging** - verbose logging shows exactly which segments are being translated
- **Consistent output** - users now get complete Portuguese subtitles instead of mixed English/Portuguese

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Google Translate batch processing** - fixed separator handling and fallback logic
- **DeepL batch processing** - applied same robustness improvements as Google Translate
- **Translation loop validation** - added safety checks in main translation orchestration
- **Graceful degradation** - keeps original text only when translation completely fails

  - Enhanced repetition removal with multiple algorithms

#### Smart Model Selection & Configuration
- **Model selection optimization** with automatic fallbacks

### 🔮 Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users
No changes required! Your existing code will continue to work exactly as before.

#### To Use New Features
```python
# Old way (still works)
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(model_size="medium")

# New way with anti-hallucination
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    anti_hallucination_config="maximum_quality"
)
```

#### For Long Video Users
If you frequently process videos >90 seconds, consider upgrading to use the new anti-hallucination features:

```python
# For podcasts/long content
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="large-v2",  # Better than large-v3 for long content
    anti_hallucination_config="podcasts"
)

# For maximum quality
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="large-v2",
    anti_hallucination_config="maximum_quality"
)
```
