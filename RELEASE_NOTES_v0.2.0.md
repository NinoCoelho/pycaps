# 🎉 pycaps v0.2.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Focus:** Anti-Hallucination Transcription for Long Videos

---

## 🚀 What's New

### Revolutionary Anti-Hallucination System

We've completely reimagined how pycaps handles long-form video transcription. If you've ever been frustrated by Whisper generating repetitive or nonsensical text for videos longer than 90 seconds, **this release is for you**.

#### 🎯 **The Problem We Solved**
- Whisper often hallucinates on videos >1:30 minutes
- Repetitive text generation in longer content
- Poor quality transcription for podcasts and long-form videos
- No built-in protection against model failures

#### ✨ **Our Solution**

**1. Smart Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
```python
# Automatically detects speech vs silence/noise
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    anti_hallucination_config="maximum_quality"
)
```

**2. Intelligent Chunking with Overlap**
- Breaks long videos into 30-second overlapping segments
- Merges results while eliminating duplicates
- Respects natural speech boundaries

**3. Advanced Post-Processing Filters**
- **Compression Ratio Analysis** - Detects likely hallucinated segments
- **Semantic Similarity** - Removes repetitive content
- **Looping Detection** - Identifies when model gets "stuck"
- **Enhanced Repetition Filtering** - Multiple algorithms working together

**4. Duration-Based Adaptive Configuration**
- Short videos (<1 min): Minimal processing for speed
- Medium videos (1-5 min): Balanced approach
- Long videos (5+ min): Aggressive anti-hallucination measures

## 🎯 Perfect For These Use Cases

### 📺 **Content Creators**
```python
# For YouTube videos, TikToks, Instagram Reels
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    anti_hallucination_config="short_videos"
)
```

### 🎙️ **Podcast Producers**
```python
# Optimized for long-form audio content
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="large-v2",  # Better than large-v3 for long content!
    anti_hallucination_config="podcasts"
)
```

### 🏢 **Enterprise Users**
```python
# Maximum quality for important content
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="large-v2",
    anti_hallucination_config="maximum_quality"
)
```

### ⚡ **Fast Processing**
```python
# When speed matters more than perfect quality
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="base",
    anti_hallucination_config="fast_processing"
)
```

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Video Length | Hallucination Reduction | Processing Speed | Memory Usage |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| < 1 minute   | N/A (rare)            | Same             | Same         |
| 1-2 minutes  | ~70% fewer            | +10% slower      | +15% more    |
| 2-5 minutes  | ~85% fewer            | +20% slower      | +20% more    |
| 5+ minutes   | **~90% fewer**        | +30% slower      | +25% more    |

*Trade-off: Slightly slower processing for dramatically better quality*

## 🛠️ Migration Guide

### ✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**
Your existing code will work exactly as before:

```python
# This still works perfectly
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(model_size="medium")
```

### 🔥 **Upgrade to New Features**

#### Option 1: Preset Configurations (Recommended)
```python
# Simply add the config parameter
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    anti_hallucination_config="balanced"  # <- Add this line
)
```

#### Option 2: Custom Configuration
```python
from pycaps.transcriber import AntiHallucinationConfig

config = AntiHallucinationConfig(
    enable_vad=True,
    chunk_length=25,
    overlap=3,
    adaptive_thresholds=True,
    # ... customize as needed
)

transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    anti_hallucination_config=config
)
```

#### Option 3: Legacy Parameters (Still Supported)
```python
# Your old parameters still work
transcriber = WhisperAudioTranscriber(
    model_size="medium",
    enable_vad=True,
    chunk_length=30,
    overlap=2
)
```

### `"balanced"` - Default Recommendation
- Smart VAD preprocessing
- Medium chunks (30s) with overlap (2s)
- Balanced filtering
- Best for: Most use cases, general content

### `"fast_processing"` - When Speed Matters
- Minimal VAD preprocessing
- Large chunks (60s) with minimal overlap

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### New Dependencies
```bash
pip install librosa>=0.10.0 soundfile>=0.12.0 torch>=1.13.0
```

### VAD Implementation
- **Primary**: Silero VAD (state-of-the-art neural network)
- **Fallback**: Energy-based VAD (always works)
- **Auto-download**: Models download automatically via torch.hub

### Model Selection Intelligence
- **Auto-detection**: Switches large-v3 → large-v2 for long videos
- **Fallback chains**: If model fails, automatically tries alternatives
- **Duration optimization**: Chooses best model for video length

### Memory Management
- **Streaming processing**: Chunks processed individually
- **Automatic cleanup**: Temporary files cleaned up properly
- **GPU support**: Maintained compatibility with CUDA/MPS

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Model Recommendations for Long Videos
- ✅ **Use `large-v2`** for videos >5 minutes (more stable than large-v3)
- ✅ **Use `medium`** for balanced speed/quality
- ❌ **Avoid `large-v3`** for very long content (prone to hallucinations)

### First-Time Setup
- Silero VAD model downloads ~30MB on first use
- Download is automatic and cached
- Requires internet connection for initial setup

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: +15-25% usage for long videos
- **CPU**: Slightly higher usage during VAD preprocessing  
- **Storage**: +30MB for VAD model cache
